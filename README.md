`xurlfind3r` is a command-line utility designed to discover URLs for a given domain in a simple, efficient way. It works by gathering information from a variety of passive sources, meaning it doesn't interact directly with the target but instead gathers data that is already publicly available. This makes `xurlfind3r` a powerful tool for security researchers, IT professionals, and anyone looking to gain insights into the URLs associated with a domain.

## Installation

### Install release binaries (Without Go Installed)

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/hueristiq/xurlfind3r/releases) and find the appropriate archive for your operating system and architecture. Download the archive from your browser or copy its URL and retrieve it with `wget` or `curl`:

* ...with `wget`:

	```bash
	wget https://github.com/hueristiq/xurlfind3r/releases/download/v<version>/xurlfind3r-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
	```

* ...or, with `curl`:

	```bash
	curl -OL https://github.com/hueristiq/xurlfind3r/releases/download/v<version>/xurlfind3r-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
	```

...then, extract the binary:

```bash
tar xf xurlfind3r-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

> [!TIP]
> The above steps, download and extract, can be combined into a single step with this onliner
> 
> ```bash
> curl -sL https://github.com/hueristiq/xurlfind3r/releases/download/v<version>/xurlfind3r-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xzv
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows systems, you should be able to double-click the zip archive to extract the `xurlfind3r` executable.

...move the `xurlfind3r` binary to somewhere in your `PATH`. For example, on GNU/Linux and OS X systems:

```bash
sudo mv xurlfind3r /usr/local/bin/
```

> [!NOTE]
> Windows users can follow [How to: Add Tool Locations to the PATH Environment Variable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee537574(v=office.14).aspx) in order to add `xurlfind3r` to their `PATH`.


### Install source (With Go Installed)

Before you install from source, you need to make sure that Go is installed on your system. You can install Go by following the official instructions for your operating system. For this, we will assume that Go is already installed.

#### `go install ...`

```bash
go install -v github.com/hueristiq/xurlfind3r/cmd/xurlfind3r@latest
```

#### `go build ...` the development Version

* Clone the repository

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/hueristiq/xurlfind3r.git 
	```

* Build the utility

	```bash
	cd xurlfind3r/cmd/xurlfind3r && \
	go build .
	```

* Move the `xurlfind3r` binary to somewhere in your `PATH`. For example, on GNU/Linux and OS X systems:

	```bash
	sudo mv xurlfind3r /usr/local/bin/
	```

	Windows users can follow [How to: Add Tool Locations to the PATH Environment Variable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee537574(v=office.14).aspx) in order to add `xurlfind3r` to their `PATH`.


> [!CAUTION]
> While the development version is a good way to take a peek at `xurlfind3r`'s latest features before they get released, be aware that it may have bugs. Officially released versions will generally be more stable.

### Install on Docker (With Docker Installed)

To install `xurlfind3r` on docker:

* Pull the docker image using:

    ```bash
    docker pull hueristiq/xurlfind3r:latest
    ```

* Run `xurlfind3r` using the image:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm hueristiq/xurlfind3r:latest -h
    ```

### Install the snap:

```
sudo snap install xurlfind3r
```

## Post Installation

`xurlfind3r` will work right after [installation](#installation). However, some sources require API keys to work. These keys can be added to a configuration file at `$HOME/.config/xurlfind3r/config.yaml`, created upon first run, or set as environment variables.

Example of environment variables for API keys:

```bash
XURLFIND3R_KEYS_BEVIGIL=your_bevigil_key
XURLFIND3R_KEYS_ONTELX=your_intelx_key
```

## Usage

To start using `xurlfind3r`, open your terminal and run the following command for a list of options:

```bash
xurlfind3r -h
```
